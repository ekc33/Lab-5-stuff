## Program Description
**Group Members: Eli Cohen and Natalya Jimenez**
The program created is used to simulate a single game of *Rock Paper Scissors*. When starting up the program, it asks the user for their name and gives a short response. 

After receiving a name as information, the program asks if the user would like to play a game of *Rock Paper Scissors*. Depending on whether or not the user chose yes or no to the game, a response will be sent out. 

If the user says no or n, a short message will be sent out, putting an end to the code.

If the user responds with yes or y, the game will play out with a short countdown timer starting from 3. Whichever combination of rock, paper, or scissors happens, if the user wins, the program will respond with recognition of the win. On the other hand, if the user loses, the program will recognize the user's loss.
There is also a response for the program tieing with the user, recognizing and expressing its hatred towards ties within *Rock, Paper, Scissors* games. If the user types a command that doesn't correspond with any available options, the program sees it as an automatic win.
